# Unplaceables
A plugin to place unplaceable tiles!

## Overview
Unplaceables is a plugin which allows users to place such world generated decoration tiles using their wrench, which they are unable to place with any Terraria item.

Features:
Place over 358 decorations within 28 types of tiles.
The Unplaceables are placed by simply using a wrench.
How-to:
1) Use the provided guide to pick your selection of Unplaceable.
2) Execute the command! Eg: /place 12 1 (Heart Crystal)
3) Click with your wrench on a solid surface to place the tile!
4) Dance of joy!

Additional info:
- After successfully placing an Unplaceable, your wrench will automatically reset and go back to placing wires.
- By using the -auto parameter, you are able to place Unplaceables continuously until you execute /place off.
- Some Unplaceables can be only placed in their own biome. Thus it will give an error message that it failed to place. (example: corrupt grass plants can only be placed on corrupt grass tiles.)

Commands:
/place help - Displays a short information about the command.
/place list - Lists all Unplaceable IDs.
/place <ID> <style> - Triggers one time tile placing.
/place <ID> <style> -auto - Enables continuous tile placing
/place off - Exits Unplaceable tile placing
Permissions:
unplaceables.place - Allows user to use /place command.
unplaceables.auto - Allows user to use the -auto parameter.
Guide:
I've created a list/guide with all the Unplaceable ID's and their styles.
